Hello from t2linux!

[38;2;23;147;209mGetting WiFi working on a t2 mac:[0m

1.  If you are on a MacBookAir8,1/2, change version of brcmfmac with this command, you will need to use mojave firmware:

    [35mdkms uninstall brcm80211-mbp16x/5.13.9[0m

2.  In root's home directory, there's a folder called "wifi-firmware", which has
    all the firmware for wifi on t2 macs, but you will need to select which
    files to use manually. There is a copy of the t2linux wiki wifi page in that
    directory with instructions. You will need to use bigSur versions of
    firmware (unless you needed to do step 1).

3.  Make sure you've now loaded brcmfmac: [35mmodprobe brcmfmac[0m
    And restarted iwd: [35msystemctl restart iwd[0m
	Now you should be able to connect with [35miwctl[0m.


There's also a local repo with some useful packages that you can add to pacstrap:

	apple-ibridge-dkms-git: touchbar driver
	apple-t2-audio-config-alt: audio config for mbp16,1/4
	apple-t2-audio-config: audio config for all other t2 macs
	brcm80211-mbp16x-dkms: wifi driver for mbp15,4, mbp16,* and mba9,1
